### **Installation**

#### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/doculaw.git
cd doculaw

2. Set Up the Backend Environment

	•	Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed.
	•	Create a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies:

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set Up the Frontend (Next.js)

	•	Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:

cd frontend
npm install

4. Set Up API Keys

You will need API keys for the language model and other services (e.g., PDF parsing). Add them to a .env file in both the backend and frontend directories:

	•	Backend .env:

MODEL_API_KEY=your-api-key

	•	Frontend .env.local:

NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000

5. Start the Backend

Start the Flask-based backend that will handle file uploads, model interactions, and API responses:

python app.py

6. Start the Frontend (Next.js)

In the frontend directory, start the Next.js development server:

npm run dev

Now you can access the application at http://localhost:3000 for the frontend interface and interact with the legal documents.

Usage

	1.	Upload your PDF: Drag and drop or select your legal document (PDF) from the Next.js frontend.
	2.	Summarization and Analysis: Select whether you want a document summary, clause-by-clause analysis, or ask specific questions in the Q&A interface.
	3.	Interact: Use the chat interface to ask detailed questions about the document and receive expert insights in real-time.
	4.	Download Results: You can download the summarized or analyzed results for further use.

Frontend Architecture (Next.js)

The frontend is built using Next.js for its efficient server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities, which help with real-time document processing.

	•	Pages:
	•	pages/index.js: The main upload and document interaction page.
	•	pages/summarize.js: Summarization page.
	•	pages/analysis.js: Clause-by-clause analysis page.
	•	pages/chat.js: Interactive Q&A page.
	•	Components:
	•	components/Upload.js: Handles PDF file uploads.
	•	components/Summary.js: Displays summarized results.
	•	components/ChatInterface.js: Manages the real-time chat interface with the document.
	•	components/Navbar.js: Navigation bar for easy access to different features.

Backend Architecture (Flask)

The backend is built using Flask to handle document processing and communication with the language model API.

	•	Key Endpoints:
	•	/upload: Endpoint to handle PDF uploads.
	•	/summarize: Summarizes the uploaded document.
	•	/analyze: Performs clause-by-clause analysis of the document.
	•	/chat: Handles the Q&A functionality with the uploaded legal document.

Configuration

The configuration for the LLM model, document handling, and API keys can be adjusted in:

	•	Backend: config.py
	•	Frontend: frontend/next.config.js and .env.local

You can modify token limits, fine-tuning parameters, and PDF parsing strategies here.

Dependencies

Backend (Python):

	•	Python 3.8+
	•	Flask
	•	PyPDF2 (for PDF handling)
	•	dotenv (for managing environment variables)
	•	Any additional legal-specific libraries

Frontend (Next.js):

	•	Next.js
	•	React.js
	•	Axios (for API requests)
	•	Tailwind CSS (optional for styling)

Roadmap

	•	Version 1.1:
	•	Add support for more file types (e.g., Word, Text).
	•	Include advanced clause extraction features.
	•	Version 1.2:
	•	Add multi-language legal document support.
	•	Optimize legal term identification for international jurisdictions.
	•	Version 2.0:
	•	Implement AI-powered contract drafting and redlining.
	•	Integrate with document management systems (DMS) and e-signature platforms.
